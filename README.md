# Galaxian

This game is a 3D remake of Galaxian built purely using JavaScript & WebGL. No external libraries. The player can fire one bullet at a time, while a random enemy ship occasionally descends to launch three bullets in rapid succession. The objective is to eliminate all enemy ships. A special mode adds intensity as enemy ships go rogue, adopting unpredictable traversal patterns and performing daring nosedives in the final stages.
